# About

This project is MIT-licensed, C++14 implementation of [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) parser and comparator with support for modifying parsed version strings. Semantic versioning 2.0.0 specification is supported out-of-the-box and the code should be flexible-enough to support future revisions or other similar versioning schemes.
