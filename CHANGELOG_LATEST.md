## [3.9.0]

This release is based on the latest Espressif/Arduino core version 3. It brings in many memory and performance optimizations. Note it does require the user to manually migrate settings from 3.8.x to 3.9.0.

## Added

- user-requested LED blink [#3063](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/3063)
- Commands Service that can be called via MQTT or API or used in the Scheduler Service
- option to disable factory reset [#3150](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/3150)
- TLS support with 4MB boards without PSRAM
- added eth_10mbit to Network Settings, which forces 10BASE-T half-duplex & autonegotiation off, halving the PHY’s power draw. It’s off by default as it will cause issues on managed switches with a port forced to 100Mb [#3213](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/pull/3213)
- cleaner MD5 and firmware uploading in WebUI [#3222](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/3222)

## Fixed

- shunting yard show json
- `system/sendmail` called from a Command or the Scheduler computed its value twice, which stripped the quotes from literal text and then failed on characters like `!`. Also shunting yard treated a `?` inside a quoted string as a ternary, so text like `"too hot?"` returned nothing
- memory leak when using different timezones for ems-esp and thermostat[#3184](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/3184)
- LED stayed off on a healthy system when "Disable LED" was unchecked
- Ethernet MAC address changed with the new SDK, breaking DHCP reservations (currently disabled)
- "IPv4 nameserver" showed an IPv6 address when IPv6 was in use
- HA Discovery warning on Uptime after EMS-ESP boot due to NTP not ready
- hc/control setting for UI800 thermostats [#3181](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/discussions/3181)
- solar module switches [#3223](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/3223)

## Changed

- various memory optimizations [#3083](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/3083)
- Scheduler name is now mandatory
- network fallback to AP only after start [#3090](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/3090)
- replaced Web async-validator with custom validator and toast with native snackbar to reduce bundle size
- Gateway and Connect devices are shown in the Devices page, but disabled [3126](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/discussions/3126)
- show control setting only for master thermostats (0x10) [#3173](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/3173)
- remove devices without entities not listed in 0x07 telegram
- changes to the Dialogs in Dashboard page, removed the run icon in the Commands page. Renamed Execute to Run.
- set `None` for undefined values in HA `val_tpl`
- changes in WebUI - remove multiple calls systemInfo endpoint, Vewrsion pages checks for internet connection [#3195](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/pull/3195)
- multiple optimization in network, power down WiFi when Ethernet and WiFi nosleep is instant when selected [#3213](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/pull/3213)
